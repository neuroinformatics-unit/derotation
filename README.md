# Derotation

The derotation package offers a robust solution for reconstructing multiphoton movies of rotating samples acquired with a line scanning microscope.

![](docs/source/_static/mean_images_with_incremental.png)
On the left, the mean image of a 3-photon movie in which the sample was rotating. In the center, the mean image after derotation, and on the left the mean image of the derotated movie after suite2p registration. As you can see, already after derotation the cells are visible and have well defined shapes.

## Quick Install

Install the latest stable release in a conda environment:
```bash
conda create -n derotation-env python=3.12
conda activate derotation-env
pip install derotation
```

> [!Note]
> Read the [documentation](https://derotation.neuroinformatics.dev) for more information, including [examples](https://derotation.neuroinformatics.dev/examples/index.html) and [API reference](https://derotation.neuroinformatics.dev/api_index.html).

## Overview
To address certain neuroscience questions, it might be necessary to image the brain while the head of the animal rotates. In such a case, and even more when the frame rate is low, the acquired movies are distorted by the rotation. These distortions have a peculiar pattern due to the line scanning nature of the microscope, which can be corrected by the derotation package.

With `derotation` you can:
- Recover calcium imaging movies by **line-by-line derotation** that can be fed into standard analysis pipelines such as [suite2p](https://github.com/MouseLand/suite2p)
- Estimate the **center of rotation** using Bayesian optimization
- Validate improvements to the derotation algorithm and pipelines using synthetic data
- Verify the quality of the derotation using debugging plotting tools
- Batch-process multiple datasets with consistent configuration files

> [!Warning]
> üèóÔ∏è The package is currently in early development and it requires rotation information coming from a step motor.

## Data Source & Funding
All microscopy data presented here as an example has been acquired with a 3-photon microscope by [Simon Weiler](https://github.com/simonweiler) in the [Margrie Lab](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/groups/margrie-lab).

This project was sponsored by the [Margrie Lab](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/groups/margrie-lab) in the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/) at University College London.
