# Derotation

The derotation package offers a robust solution for reconstructing movies of rotating samples acquired with a line scanning microscope.

![](docs/source/_static/dark_derotation.gif)

## Quick Install

Install the latest stable release in a conda environment:
```bash
conda create -n derotation-env python=3.12
conda activate derotation-env
pip install derotation
```

> [!Note]
> Read the [documentation](https://derotation.neuroinformatics.dev) for more information, including [examples](https://derotation.neuroinformatics.dev/examples/index.html) and [API reference](https://derotation.neuroinformatics.dev/api_index.html).

## Overview
To address certain neuroscience questions, it might be necessary to image the brain while the head or the body of the animal rotates. In such a case, and even more when the frame rate is low, the acquired movies are distorted by the rotation. These distortions have a peculiar pattern due to the line scanning nature of the microscope, which can be corrected by the derotation package.

With `derotation` you can:
- Recover calcium imaging movies by **line-by-line derotation** that can be fed into standard analysis pipelines such as [suite2p](https://github.com/MouseLand/suite2p)
- Estimate the **center of rotation** using Bayesian optimization
- Validate improvements to the derotation algorithm and pipelines using synthetic data
- Verify the quality of the derotation using debugging plotting tools
- Batch-process multiple datasets with consistent configuration files

> [!Warning]
> üèóÔ∏è The package is currently in early development and it requires rotation information coming from a step motor.

## Data Source & Funding
All microscopy data presented here as an example has been acquired with a 3-photon microscope by [Simon Weiler](https://github.com/simonweiler) in the [Margrie Lab](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/groups/margrie-lab).

This project was sponsored by the [Margrie Lab](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/groups/margrie-lab) in the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/) at University College London.
