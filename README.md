# Derotation

The derotation package offers a robust solution for reconstructing images of rotating samples acquired with a line scanning microscope. It provides a set of tools to undo distortions caused by the rotation, including line-by-line derotation and center of rotation estimation.

## Quick Install

To install the latest stable release:
```bash
pip install derotation
```

For a conda environment:
```bash
conda create -n derotation-env python=3.12
conda activate derotation-env
```

> [!Note]
> Read the [documentation](https://derotation.neuroinformatics.dev) for more information, including [full installation instructions](https://derotation.neuroinformatics.dev/user_guide/installation.html) and [examples](https://derotation.neuroinformatics.dev/examples/index.html).

## Overview
To address certain neuroscience questions in rodents, it might be necessary to image the brain while the head or the body of the animal rotates. In such a case, and even more when the frame rate is low, the acquired movies are distorted by the rotation. These distortions have a peculiar pattern due to the line scanning nature of the microscope, which can be corrected by the derotation package. 

`derotation` provides a set of tools to undo these distortions:
- Recover calcium imaging movies by **line-by-line derotation** that can be fed into standard analysis pipelines such as suite2p;
- Estimate the **center of rotation** using ellipse fitting or Bayesian optimization;
- Validate improvements to the derotation algorithm and pipelines using synthetic data;
- Use debugging plots and logs to verify the quality of the derotation;
- Batch-process multiple datasets with consistent configuration files.

> [!Warning]
> üèóÔ∏è The package is currently in early development and it requires rotation information coming from a step motor.
