## Overview
To address certain neuroscience questions in rodents, it might be necessary to image the brain while the head or the body of the animal rotates. In such a case, and even more when the frame rate is low, the acquired movies are distorted by the rotation. These distortions have a peculiar pattern due to the line scanning nature of the microscope, which can be corrected by the derotation package.

With `derotation` you can:
- Recover calcium imaging movies by **line-by-line derotation** that can be fed into standard analysis pipelines such as suite2p;
- Estimate the **center of rotation** using Bayesian optimization;
- Validate improvements to the derotation algorithm and pipelines using synthetic data;
- Use debugging plots and logs to verify the quality of the derotation;
- Batch-process multiple datasets with consistent configuration files.

The package is currently in early development and it requires rotation information coming from a step motor.
