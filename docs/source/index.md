## Overview

Many neuroscience experiments involve rotating samples under a microscope. These rotations, while essential, can introduce spatial distortions into recorded image stacks.

`derotation` provides a set of tools to undo these distortions:
- Recover interpretable images by **line-by-line derotation**.
- Estimate the **center of rotation** using ellipse fitting or Bayesian optimization.
- Validate your process using synthetic data and debugging plots.
- Batch-process multiple datasets with consistent configuration files.

Check out our [mission and scope](target-mission) and our [roadmap](target-roadmaps) for more on the project's direction.
