	abstract = {To interpret visual-motion events, the underlying computation must involve internal reference to the motion status of the observer’s head. We show here that layer 6 (L6) principal neurons in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) receive a diffuse, vestibular-mediated synaptic input that signals the angular velocity of horizontal rotation. Behavioral and theoretical experiments indicate that these inputs, distributed over a network of 100 L6 neurons, provide both a reliable estimate and, therefore, physiological separation of head-velocity signals. During head rotation in the presence of visual stimuli, L6 neurons exhibit postsynaptic responses that approximate the arithmetic sum of the vestibular and visual-motion response. Functional input mapping reveals that these internal motion signals arrive into L6 via a direct projection from the retrosplenial cortex. We therefore propose that visual-motion processing in V1 L6 is multisensory and contextually dependent on the motion status of the animal’s head.},

	abstract = {Neurons that signal the angular velocity of head movements (AHV cells) are important for processing visual and spatial information. However, it has been challenging to isolate the sensory modality that drives them and to map their cortical distribution. To address this, we develop a method that enables rotating awake, headﬁxed mice under a two-photon microscope in a visual environment. Starting in layer 2/3 of the retrosplenial cortex, a key area for vision and navigation, we ﬁnd that 10\% of neurons report angular head velocity (AHV). Their tuning properties depend on vestibular input with a smaller contribution of vision at lower speeds. Mapping the spatial extent, we ﬁnd AHV cells in all cortical areas that we explored, including motor, somatosensory, visual, and posterior parietal cortex. Notably, the vestibular and visual contributions to AHV are area dependent. Thus, many cortical circuits have access to AHV, enabling a diverse integration with sensorimotor and cognitive information.},

            Spatial cognition depends on an accurate representation of orientation within an environment. Head direction cells in distributed brain regions receive a range of sensory inputs, but visual input is particularly important for aligning their responses to environmental landmarks. To investigate how population-level heading responses are aligned to visual input, we recorded from retrosplenial cortex (RSC) of head-fixed mice in a moving environment using two-photon calcium imaging. We show that RSC neurons are tuned to the animal’s relative orientation in the environment, even in the absence of head movement. Next, we found that RSC receives functionally distinct projections from visual and thalamic areas and contains several functional classes of neurons. While some functional classes mirror RSC inputs, a newly discovered class coregisters visual and thalamic signals. Finally, decoding analyses reveal unique contributions to heading from each class. Our results suggest an RSC circuit for anchoring heading representations to environmental visual landmarks.},

	abstract = {Active ampliﬁcation of organized synaptic inputs in dendrites can endow individual neurons with the ability to perform complex computations. However, whether dendrites in behaving animals perform independent local computations is not known. Such activity may be particularly important for complex behavior, where neurons integrate multiple streams of information. Head-restrained imaging has yielded important insights into cellular and circuit function, but this approach limits behavior and the underlying computations. We describe a method for fullfeatured 2-photon imaging in awake mice during free locomotion with volitional head rotation. We examine head direction and position encoding in simultaneously imaged apical tuft dendrites and their respective cell bodies in retrosplenial cortex, an area that encodes multi-modal navigational information. Activity in dendrites was not determined solely by somatic activity but reﬂected distinct navigational variables, fulﬁlling the requirements for dendritic computation. Our approach provides a foundation for studying sub-cellular processes during complex behaviors.},
