## Methodological appendix
The package has been directly tested on 3-photon imaging data obtained from cortical layer 6 callosal-projecting neurons expressing the calcium indicator GCaMP7f in the mouse visual cortex (see Figure 3 in the main paper). More specifically, wild type C57/B6 mice were injected with retro AAV-hSyn-Cre (1 × $10^{14}$ units per ml) in the left and with AAV2/1.syn.FLEX.GCaMP7f (1.8 × $10^{13}$ units per ml) in the right primary visual cortex. A cranial window was implanted over the right hemisphere, and then a headplate was cemented onto the skull of the animal. After 4 weeks of viral expression and recovery, animals were head-fixed on a rotation platform driven by a direct-drive motor (U-651, Physik Instrumente). 360 degree clockwise and counter-clockwise rotations with different peak speed profiles (50, 100, 150, 200 deg/s) were performed while imaging awake neuronal activity using a 25x objective (XLPLN25XWMP2, NA 1.05, 25, Olympus). Imaging was conducted at 7 Hz with 256x256 pixels. All experimental procedures were approved by the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre (SWC) Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body (AWERB). For detailed description of the 3-photon power source and imaging please see Cloves & Margrie (2024).
